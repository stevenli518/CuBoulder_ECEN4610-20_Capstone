### Project Info:
An electrosurgical device, or ESU, is a surgical incision device used to incise and remove organic tissue efficiently while controlling bleeding. As it currently stands, ESUs are inaccessible to many parts of the world due to their power generatorâ€™s steep cost and large size. Our product is a smaller, less expensive ESU, a complete system with a generator, which runs off of an AC wall connection along with batteries. A portable, relatively cheap generator that connects to pre-existing Ligasure devices reliably provides the electrical signals and control functions required by the ESUs, which along with a clear guided user interface makes this ESU system accessible to medical fields in developing countries.
